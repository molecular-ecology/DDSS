### main_best_hit.R

Main script to process data from BlastNToSnp with custom script to acquire 100% identity matches. It corrects text in characters, che
cks degenerate bases and eliminates records with matches, corrects the number of mismatches, calculates best percent identity for a give
n overlap length on each alignment. It gives the hit with the highest percent identity for each overlap length, and summarizes the data 
by giving the number of reads for each overlap length, percent identity threshold and hit species.
